# NubiPACS
“The PACS That Speaks Your Language.”

A lightweight, customizable PACS server with DICOM, ~~DICOMweb, HL7, and API support for modern medical imaging~~.

### DEVELOPMENT PAUSED
Unfortunately, the development of this PACS proved to be unfeasible since the libraries used and the language have several performance problems.

I still intend to build another PACS but in C++ or create a Python library with a lower level and better performance.

## Motivation
Other PACS lacks of a lot of features that i use to need to make workarounds..

## Highlight Features
- Study Lifecycle
- Multiple Storage Query
- Webhooks
- Support for Replicas
- Storage Explorer??
- Storage as a Proxy (Storage to connect with another PACS DICOM/DICOMWeb)
- Hibrid Model (Link with another PACS / Use one without internet)
- Integrity Chck on Storage
- Easy to Use API
